# Markup: I have changed the markup for my index.html nav bar from <ul> to a line of links, such that it would look more neat.

# Style: I have added borders and colors to the links to improve the visual of the site. I also added some hover effect to enhance the user experience.

# Content: I have added explainations to my hobbies such that users could be easier to understand the topics.
